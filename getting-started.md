# Getting Started

### Different CFWs

The first thing to decide is what CFW you want to use.

There are two main CFWs:

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Haxchi**
- Requires a legitimately installed paid DS VC game from the eShop.
- Can be used to launch CFW directly from the Wii U Menu.
- Needs to be re-launched from the Wii U Menu every reboot to enable CFW.
- It's functionality can be extended by installing ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) to a Haxchi installation.

#### **Haxchi and ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC)**
!> Installing CBHC incorrectly can brick your Wii U. Make sure to follow the following rules when installing CBHC:
  - The DS game has to be legitimately installed from the eShop
  - Don't format the system while CBHC is installed
  - Don't delete the user account that bought the DS VC game
  - Don't re-install the same game using wup installer or from the eShop
  - Don't install Haxchi over CBHC

- Requires a working Haxchi installation.
- Automatically launches CFW on every boot.
