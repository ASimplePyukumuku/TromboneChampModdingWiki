# Getting Started

### Different CFWs

?> Before starting, make sure to update your Wii U console to the latest firmware (5.5.4 for European consoles, 5.5.3 for all other regions) if you haven't already.

The first thing to decide is what CFW you want to use.

There are two main CFWs: Haxchi/ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC), and Mocha.<br>
The table below lists advantages and disadvantages of each option.

#### **Haxchi**
- Requires a legitimately installed paid DS VC game from the eShop.
- Can be used to launch CFW directly from the Wii U Menu.
- Needs to be re-launched from the Wii U Menu every reboot to enable CFW.
- It's functionality can be extended by installing ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) to a Haxchi installation.

#### **CBHC**
!> Installing CBHC incorrectly can brick your Wii U. Make sure to follow the following rules when installing CBHC:<br>- The DS game has to be legitimately installed from the eShop<br>- Don't format the system while CBHC is installed<br>- Don't delete the user account that bought the DS VC game<br>- Don't re-install the same game using wup installer or from the eShop<br>- Don't install Haxchi over CBHC

- Requires a working Haxchi installation.
- Automatically launches CFW on every boot.

#### **Mocha**
- Does not require any game, and is therefore free.
- Needs to be re-launched through the browser exploit every reboot to enable CFW.
