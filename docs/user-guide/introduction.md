### What can you do with mods? {docsify-ignore}

While modding Gorilla Tag is at its early stage, you can:
- Customize your gorilla with custom materials, infected materials, and hats with [*Gorilla Cosmetics*](https://github.com/legoandmars/GorillaCosmetics)
- Fly, power jump, and float in anti-gravity with [*Super Monke*](https://github.com/jeydevv/Super-Monke)
- Make your jumps huge with *Space Monke* (available in the GorillaTag Modding Discord)

More mods will be developed as time progresses, and will be published in the **Downloads** category on the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv).

### Is modding the game safe? {docsify-ignore}

Modding the game is allowed by the developers of Gorilla Tag, however keep in mind the following:

!> The use of mods inside public lobbies is forbidden by the developers and can result in a ban. Please keep mods contained to private lobbies.

### End Goal {docsify-ignore}

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Gorilla Tag installation from vanilla to modded with BepInEx.

> For now, this guide only applies to the PC version of Gorilla Tag. Quest instructions will be added at a later date when a mod manager for Quest is developed.
