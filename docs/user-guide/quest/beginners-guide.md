## Installing QuestPatcher

Currently the only recommended way to install mods is **QuestPatcher**. Download **QuestPatcher** from [Lauriethefish's GitHub](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher/releases/latest).

### Windows

> The only version of Windows officially supported is Windows 10.
> Other versions might work, but we cannot guarantee full functionality.

1. Select the assets dropdown on github, and click `QuestPatcher-windows.exe`, then wait for the download to finish.
2. Open your downloads folder, and double click the installer.
3. It's possible that windows will prevent you from opening the installer, as it is from an unknown source. Just press `More Info` and `Run Anyway`.
4. Select `Install for all users` or `Install for me only` and press `Yes` if an admin prompt comes up.
5. Accept the license agreement, press next, press next again, then press install.
6. Wait until the install finishes, then press next, and then finish to open QuestPatcher.


### Mac OS

!> QuestPatcher should automatically download Java. If you're on an older version of Mac OS, Java might be detected as already installed when it isn't. If you are having trouble patching, manually download Java [here](https://www.java.com/en/).

1. Select the assets dropdown on github, and click `QuestPatcher-mac.dmg`, then wait for the download to finish.
2. Open your downloads folder, and double click `QuestPatcher-mac.dmg`.
3. Drag the QuestPatcher application into the Applications folder.
4. Close the DMG window, right click QuestPatcher on your desktop and click `Eject "QuestPatcher"`.
5. Open your Applications folder and right click QuestPatcher. **__Make sure you hold control__**, then click open (You will only have to do this the first time).
6. In the unrecognized developer that comes up, click `Open`.

### Linux

> QuestPatcher is compiled for [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) Linux.
> Other linux distributions may work, but you may encounter issues.

!> These instructions are more complicated than Mac and Windows, and it is recommended that you know your way around a terminal.

1. Select the assets dropdown on github, and click `QuestPatcher-ubuntu.zip`, then wait for the download to finish.
2. Extract the ZIP file using Archive Manager.
3. Enter the extracted folder, right click, then press `Open in Terminal`.
4. Type in `chmod +x QuestPatcher` and press enter.
5. If all goes well, type in `./QuestPatcher` and QuestPatcher will load.
