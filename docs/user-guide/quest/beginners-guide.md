## Installation

Currently the only recommended way to install mods is **QuestPatcher**. Download **QuestPatcher** from [Lauriethefish's GitHub](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher/releases/latest). Select the **Assets** dropdown and download the .zip file named `QuestPatcher.zip`. Extract this zip file to a folder of your choosing (that is not a folder that requires administrator permissions like Program Files.)

> Note: If Windows alerts you that the file is unsafe/at risk, choose to keep/run anyway. This is a false-positive.

## Install Instructions

?> **Plug in your Quest to your computer** ***first*** **before running QuestPatcher.**

After you've downloaded and extracted QuestPatcher, double-click the executable to run it.
By default, QuestPatcher should automatically detect your Gorilla Tag app.

?> If you get a red message in QuestPatcher saying "*App with specified ID could not be found*", check that your Quest is plugged in, and you have Gorilla Tag installed from SideQuest.

Hit the *Patch my app!* button to begin patching Gorilla Tag. You'll see the log window showing the progress.

!> **Do NOT unplug the Quest from the computer while QuestPatcher is patching Gorilla Tag.**

After this, you'll be brought to the mod management screen, which means Gorilla Tag has been successfully modded. Congratulations!

## Managing Mods

### Installing Mods

Once QuestPatcher is finished, you'll be brought to this screen. **If you are relaunching QuestPatcher in the future to manage your mods, be sure to select the "*I've already modded my game*" button to be brought directly to this screen.**

Next, click the *Browse for Mods* button, and locate a .qmod you would like to install, and open it. You can download the mod(s) you wish to install from GitHub, the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv) **#quest-mod-releases** channel, or other sources. **Make sure to download any dependencies required by the mod.**

After opening the .qmods you wish to install, they should appear in the mod management screen. You can repeat this process to install whatever mods you like.

Select the *Uninstall mod* button within the mod management screen to uninstall that mod.
