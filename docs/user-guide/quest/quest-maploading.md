# Quest Custom Maps Installation
---
>
> This guide only applies to the Quest version of Gorilla Tag.
> If you're using a SteamVR headset or a Quest **with Link**, go to the [**PC Custom Maps Installation**](pc-maploading) guide.

?> `.gtmap` files are cross compatible between PC and Quest, so you can crossplay with your friends, on any platform!

## Installing Maps
?> **Don't have a modded game?** Check out the guide to mod Gorilla Tag for Quest and install QuestPatcher [here](quest-guide)!

!> **Make sure to install the Monke Map Loader mod!** You can download it from [**RedBrumbler's GitHub**](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/MonkeMapLoader/releases/latest).

Once you have Monke Map Loader and your modded game, plug in your Quest to your computer, open **QuestPatcher**, and drag `.gtmap` files inside the window.

**Not sure where to find these?** Head to [monkemaphub.com](https://monkemaphub.com), where you can find all released maps for the map loader. Click the logo below to head there!

## Loading Maps
In game, head to the computer and press enter to skip the Banana OS splash screen. Use the arrow keys to select **Map Loader**, then press enter. Then, use the arrow keys to select a map from the list of your installed `.gtmap` files. You'll see an orb like the one below spinning with a preview of the map.

Then, you can press enter to see more details, and if you want to load it, press enter one more time and wait for the "MAP LOADED" confirmation. After that, hop in the teleporter! Monke!

## Public Lobbies & Custom Maps

?> Although you're normally not supposed to use mods in public matches, the Monke Map Loader implements a special solution that make it OK to do.
When you select a custom map and join a public match by going through the teleporter, you're actually joining a private match that matchmakes you with other people playing that map.
It's only possible to join these matches if you have the Monke Map Loader installed, so joining public matches is not only fine, but recommended.
