## Instructions

After you've downloaded Monke Mod Manager, double-click the executable to run it.

By default, Monke Mod Manager should automatically fill in your Gorilla Tag folder path.  
The default path is: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag`.  

?> If you installed Gorilla Tag to a seperate path, be sure to select it with the `..` button on the right.  
**The path might be in this location.** Replace the drive letter `F` with the drive your game is installed on.  
`F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag`

Next, you may select any mods that are listed. BepInEx is the modloader for Gorilla Tag and cannot be unchecked. To update a mod, simply select the installed mod again.

After you select the mods you would like to install/update, hit the Install/Update button to begin the process. When the status monitor in the bottom left says "**Install complete!**", you're good to go!
