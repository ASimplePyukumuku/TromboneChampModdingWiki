# Choose The CFW You Want

?> Before starting, make sure to update your Wii U console to the latest firmware (5.5.4 for European consoles, 5.5.3 for all other regions) if you haven't already.

There are two main CFWs: Haxchi/ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) and Mocha.

## **Haxchi**

- Requires a legitimately installed paid DS VC game from the eShop.
- Can be used to launch CFW directly from the Wii U Menu.
- Needs to be re-launched from the Wii U Menu every reboot to enable CFW.
- Its functionality can be extended by installing ColdBootHaxchi (CBHC) to a Haxchi installation.

## **CBHC**

!> Installing CBHC incorrectly can brick your Wii U. Make sure to follow the following rules when installing CBHC:
<br>- The DS game has to be legitimately installed from the eShop
<br>- Don't format the system while CBHC is installed
<br>- Don't delete the user account that bought the DS VC game
<br>- Don't re-install the same game using WUP Installer or from the eShop
<br>- Don't install Haxchi over CBHC

!> Breaking one of the above rules will result in a brick.

- Same (dis)advantages as Haxchi, but automatically launches CFW on every boot.

## **Mocha**

- Does not require any game, and is therefore free.
- Needs to be re-launched through the browser exploit every reboot to enable CFW.
- Is not compatible with the Homebrew Launcher Channel
