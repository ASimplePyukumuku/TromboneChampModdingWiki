### Dump and Install Your Wii U Game Discs

You can [dump your Wii U game discs to your SD Card using disc2app and then install said dumps using WUP Installer GX2](extras/dump-games) either to the NAND or to a Wii U formatted USB drive.  

?> Don't know what a Wii U formatted USB drive is? [Click here](extras/faq?id=what-is-a-wii-u-formatted-usb-drive).

### Backup and Restore Your Games' Save Data

You can use [SaveMii Mod](https://github.com/GabyPCgeeK/savemii/releases) to backup, restore and delete your games' save data. You can also import your games' save data from Loadiine.  

?>You will need to launch a CFW (Mocha, Haxchi or CBHC) before launching SaveMii Mod.

### Make and Install Virtual Console Injections

You can make Virtual Console injects with [Injectiine](https://gbatemp.net/threads/original-injectiine-wii-u-virtual-console-injector.491386/) for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Nintendo 64 (N64), GameBoy Advance (GBA) and Nintendo DS (NDS) games. And [TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-wiivc-injector-script-gc-wii-homebrew-support.483577/) for Wii and GameCube games.  
Virtual Console injects can be installed either to the NAND or to a Wii U formatted USB drive and can be run from the Wii U Menu.  
You will also need to launch a CFW (Mocha, Haxchi or CBHC) in order to run said Virtual Console injects.

?> DSi enhanced games are not and will never be compatible with Nintendo's Virtual Console emulator.

### Mod your vWii

You don't need to mod your vWii if you only want to play Wii and GameCube games, [VC injects](extras/cfw-uses?id=make-and-install-virtual-console-injections) will work even with an unmodded vWii since those are run from the Wii U Menu.  

But if you want to manage your copy protected games' save data, mod your games, cheat and more, you will need to [mod your vWii](vwii/vwii-modding).
